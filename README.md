# Node.js project boilerplate

This repository is intended to be used as a template when creating new Node.js-based projects.

## Setup

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript run-time environment, which enables the use of JavaScript-based server-side scripts. In order to use it, you must first have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following in your terminal:

```
node -v && npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, follow the [installation instructions on the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Download the repository

To get started working locally on your computer first clone or download this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/illusivesunrae/node-project-boilerplate.git
cd node-project-boilerplate
```

## Next steps

Now that you have a copy of this repository, you will likely want to add build tools. You can find instructions on using three of the most common build tools — webpack, Gulp, and Grunt — in our wiki.
